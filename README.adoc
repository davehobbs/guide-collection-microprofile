== What you'll learn

You'll learn how to create and run a simple cloud native microservice. Then, you'll update the microservice that you created and deploy it to Kubernetes or Knative. This process will be done by using the Eclipse MicroProfile Kabanero Collection with the link:https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/cli-commands[Appsody CLI]. Deployment to Knative is optional depending on whether you want to Scale to Zero.

Kabanero's Eclipse MicroProfile Collection provides an application stack that enables the development and optimization of microservices. With application stacks, developers don't need to manage full software development stacks or be experts on underlying container technologies or Kubernetes. Application stacks are customized for specific enterprises to incorporate their company standards and technology choices.

Applications in this guide are written based on the Eclipse MicroProfile API specifications, built and run with the link:https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty] runtime, and deployed to Kubernetes through a modern DevOps toolchain that is triggered in Git.

// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Prerequisites

* link:https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] must be installed.
* link:https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation[Appsody] must be installed.
* *Optional*: If you have a repository that contains a set of custom collections, then you need the URL where the collections' `index.yaml` file is available. Use this URL to make your custom collections available with the Appsody CLI.
* *Optional*: If you are testing multiple microservices together, then you must have access to a local Kubernetes cluster for local development. If you are using Docker Desktop, you can enable Kubernetes from the menu by selecting Preferences -> Kubernetes -> Enable Kubernetes. Other options include link:https://www.okd.io/minishift/[Minishift] or link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/[Minikube].

// =================================================================================================
// Configuring Appsody
// =================================================================================================

=== *Configuring Appsody*

*Note*: The use of the public Kabanero Collection Hub is only for the purposes of this guide. It is recommended that you make a private copy of the Kabanero Collection Hub and use it in the same way. However, this demonstration does not require that you make your own copy.

Add your Kabanero index to the Appsody CLI. The following example uses the public index for Kabanero Version 0.5.0.

To check the repositories that Appsody can already access, run the following command:
[role="command"]
----
appsody repo list
----

You see an output similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
NAME        URL
*incubator https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
----

Next, run the following command to add the Kabanero index:
[role="command"]
----
appsody repo add kabanero https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/0.5.0/kabanero-index.yaml
----

Check the existing repositories to see that it was added:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
NAME        URL
*incubator https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
kabanero    https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/0.5.0/kabanero-index.yaml
----

In this example, the asterisk (*) shows that `incubator` is the default repository. Run the following command to set the Kabanero index as the default repository:
[role="command"]
----
appsody repo set-default kabanero
----

Check the existing repositories to see that it was updated:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
NAME        URL
incubator  https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
*kabanero   https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/0.5.0/kabanero-index.yaml
----

*Recommendation*: In enterprise settings, when a solution architect creates application stacks with technology choices that are in a private Collection Hub, it's best to remove `incubator` from the list. These Appsody stacks are not supported by the Kabanero application cluster.

Run the following command to remove the incubator repository:
[role="command"]
----
appsody repo remove incubator
----

Check the existing repositories to see the change:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
NAME     	URL
*kabanero	https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/0.5.0/kabanero-index.yaml
----

Your Appsody CLI is now configured to use the Kabanero Collections. Next, you need to initialize your project.

// =================================================================================================
// Initializing your project
// =================================================================================================

=== *Initializing your project*

First, create a directory that will contain the project:
[role="command"]
----
mkdir -p ~/projects/simple-microprofile
cd ~/projects/simple-microprofile
----

Run the following command to initialize the project with the Appsody CLI:
[role="command"]
----
appsody init java-microprofile
----

The output from the command varies depending on whether you have an installation of Java and Maven on your system. If Java and Maven are installed on your system, you see an output similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----

// Understanding the project layout
// =================================================================================================

=== *Understanding the project layout*

For context, the following image displays the structure of the project that you're working on:

image::/img/guide/microprofile-project-layout.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-project-layout.png" alt="Project structure"]
{empty} +

It contains the following artifacts:

* `StarterApplication.java`, a JAX-RS Application class
* `server.xml`, an Open Liberty server configuration file
* `index.html`, a static HTML file
* `pom.xml`, a project build file

// =================================================================================================
// Running the Appsody development environment
// =================================================================================================

== Running the Appsody development environment

Run the following command to start the Appsody development environment:
[role="command"]
----
appsody run
----

The Appsody CLI launches a local Docker image that contains an Open Liberty server that hosts the microservice. After some time, you see a message similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKF0011I: The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet. The defaultServer server started in 20.235 seconds.
----

This message indicates that the server is started and you are ready to begin developing your application.

// =================================================================================================
// Creating and updating the application
// =================================================================================================

== Creating and updating the application

// Now you can create your business logic. The first thing to do is to add a REST endpoint. Navigate to the JAX-RS application endpoint to confirm that there are no JAX-RS resources //available. Go to the http://localhost:9080/starter URL. You see the following `HTTP 500` error that states that there are no provider or resource classes that are associated with the application:
// [source, role='no_copy']
// ----
// Error 500: javax.servlet.ServletException: At least one provider or resource class should be specified for application class "dev.appsody.starter.StarterApplication
// ----

Now you can create your business logic. Typically, you put your business logic in a JAX-RS resource. First, you need to add a REST endpoint.

Create a `StarterResource.java` class in the `src/main/java/dev/appsody/starter` directory. Open the file, populate it with the following code, and save it:
[source,java]
----
package dev.appsody.starter;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
@Path("/resource")
public class StarterResource {
    @GET
    public String getRequest() {
        return "StarterResource response";
    }
}
----

After you save, the source compiles and the application updates. You see messages similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKT0017I: Web application removed (default_host): http://85862d8696be:9080/
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKZ0009I: The application starter-app has stopped successfully.
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://85862d8696be:9080/
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKZ0003I: The application starter-app updated in 0.988 seconds.
----

The resource that you just added is available at the `starter/resource` URL path. Go to the http://localhost:9080/starter/resource URL to see the following resource response:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
StarterResource response
----

Try changing the message in the `StarterResource.java` file, saving, and refreshing the page. You'll see that it takes only a few seconds for the change to take effect.

//
// == Stopping the Appsody development environment
// Use `Ctrl-C` to stop the Appsody development environment.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the application
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the application

If you are building an application that is composed of microservices, you need to test within the context of the overall system. First, test your application and perform unit testing in isolation. To test the application as part of the system, deploy the system and then the new application.

You can choose how you want to deploy the system and application. If you have adequate CPU and memory to run MiniShift, the application, and the associated services, then you can deploy the application on a local Kubernetes that is running on your computer. Alternatively, you can enable Docker Desktop for Kubernetes, which is described in the Prerequisites section of the guide.

You can also deploy the system, application, and the associated services in a private namespace on a development cluster. From this private namespace, you can commit the microservices in Git repositories and deploy them through a DevOps pipeline, not directly to Kubernetes.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing locally on Kubernetes
// =================================================================================================

=== *Testing locally on Kubernetes*

After you finish writing your application code, the Appsody CLI makes it easy to deploy directly to a Kubernetes cluster for further local testing. The ability to deploy directly to a Kubernetes cluster is valuable when you want to test multiple microservices together or test with services that the application requires.

Ensure that your `kubectl` command is configured with cluster details, and run the following command to deploy your application:
[role="command"]
----
appsody deploy
----

This command builds a new Docker image that is optimized for production deployment and deploys the image to your local Kubernetes cluster. After some time you see a message similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
Deployed project running at http://localhost:30262
----

Run the following command to check the status of the application pods:
[role="command"]
----
kubectl get pods
----

You see an output similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
NAME                                  READY    STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
appsody-operator-859b97bb98-htpgw      1/1     Running   0         3m2s
simple-microprofile-77d6868765-xkcpk   1/1     Running   0         31s
----

The pod that is related to your deployed application is similar to the following pod:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
simple-microprofile-77d6868765-xkcpk   1/1     Running   0         31s
----

After the `simple-microprofile` pod starts, go to the URL that was returned after you ran the `appsody deploy` command, and you see the Appsody microservice splash screen. To see the response from your application, point your browser to `<URL_STRING>/starter/resource`, where `<URL_STRING>` is the URL that was returned. For example, the http://localhost:30262 URL was returned in the previous example. Go to the http://localhost:30262/starter/resource URL to see the deployed application response.

Use the following command to stop the deployed application:
[role="command"]
----
appsody deploy delete
----

After you run this command, and the deployment is deleted, you see the following message:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
Deployment deleted
----

// =================================================================================================
// Testing with Knative Serving
// =================================================================================================

=== *Testing with Knative Serving*

You can choose to test an application that is deployed with Knative Serving to take advantage of Scale to Zero. Not all applications can be written to effectively take advantage of Scale to Zero. The Kabanero operator-based installation configures Knative on the Kubernetes cluster, specifically OKD 3.11. Because of the resources that are required to run Knative and its dependencies, testing locally can be difficult. Publish to Kubernetes by using pipelines that are described later in the guide. Your operations team can configure the pipelines so that Knative Serving is enabled for deployment.

// =================================================================================================
// Publishing to Kubernetes by using pipelines
// =================================================================================================

== Publishing to Kubernetes by using pipelines

After you develop and test your application in your local environment, it's time to publish it to your enterprise's pipeline. From your enterprise's pipeline, you can deploy the application to the appropriate Kubernetes cluster for staging or production. Complete this process in Git.

When Kabanero is installed, deploying applications to a Kubernetes cluster always occurs through the DevOps pipeline that is triggered in Git. Using DevOps pipelines to deploy applications ensures that developers can focus on application code, not on containers or Kubernetes infrastructure. From an enterprise perspective, this deployment process ensures that both the container image build and the deployment to Kubernetes or Knative happen in a secure and consistent way that meets company standards.

To deliver your application to the pipeline, push the project to the pre-configured Git repository that has a configured webhook. This configured webhook triggers the enterprise build and deploy pipeline.

// == Nice work!
